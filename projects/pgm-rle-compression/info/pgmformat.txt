This text file describes the format of a PGM image file.
It is basically a text header followed by an array of pixel values (bytes).

Pixel values
------------

In a PGM image file, the data is stored as a long list of bytes that represent
the grey scale value (an integer between 0 and 255) of each pixel in the
image. The list starts with the pixel in the top left hand corner of the 
image then goes horizontally left to right until it reaches the pixel in the
top right corner. The list then moves on to the next horizontal line of the
image - the one second from top - and so on until it reaches the bottom of the
image. The last byte in the list corresponds to the pixel at the bottom right
of the image. 

For a 256 x 256 pixel image, there are 256*256 (=65536) pixels whose 
byte values are stored consecutively in the PGM file:

b0, b1, b2, b3, .... b65535

These pixels fit into the image in the following pattern:

b0         b1             b2             ...    b255
b256       b257           b258           ...    b511
:          :              :              ...    :
b(255*256) b(255*256 + 1) b(255*256 + 2) ...    b65535

Header
------

There is also a header on the image file. There are three lines in the file
before the list of byte values begins. If you type 'more im1.pgm' for example,
you'll see this.

The header has the following format:

P5
<x> <y>
<max>

The first line always contains the two characters 'P5', which indicates that
this file is a PGM file.
The second line defines the size of the image - x pixels horizontally and y
pixels vertically.
<max> is the maximum value that a pixel can contain. For all our images it is
255 and you can assume this will always be the case.

For example, the three line header of a 256x256 pixel image is:

P5
256 256
255

For a 512x512 image, it is:

P5
512 512
255

BEWARE: If you try and use any other images than the ones I've given you, you
might find additional lines in the header that contain comments. These lines
always start with a #. For example:

P5
# CREATOR: XV Version 3.10a  Rev: 12/29/94
256 256
255

is a valid header. xv always adds these comments in when you save an image as
a PGM file. In general, the header can contain as many of these comment lines
as it likes. You may want to cope with this in your code, but it's not
necessary if you just stick to these ten images.

Reading in a PGM file
---------------------

The general strategy is:

- open the file (use the class java.io.DataInputStream)
- read in the first line of the header and check it contains 'P5'.
- read in the second line containing the two integers specifying the size
- check if its a comment line - while the line starts with #, read in the next line
- extract the two integers that specify the size of the image from that line
- read in the last line of the header and check it contains 255.

- allocate a 2D array the size of the image
- read in the pixel values one by one and put them into appropriate slot of 
  the array.
  
Good luck.
